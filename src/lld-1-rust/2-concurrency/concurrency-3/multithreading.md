A theoretical overview of how to solve each of the common issues associated with multithreading:

1. Race Conditions(Adder - Subtractor Problem):

Solution: Use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or atomic operations to ensure that only one thread can access shared resources at a time. Properly designed critical sections can prevent race conditions.

2. Deadlocks:

Solution: Apply deadlock prevention strategies, such as ensuring that resources are always acquired in a consistent order, using timeouts for resource acquisition, or employing deadlock detection and recovery algorithms.

3. Livelocks:

Solution: Avoid livelocks by making sure that threads make progress in their tasks and do not continuously change their state in response to each other. Introducing randomness or backoff strategies in decision-making can help break the cycle.

4. Starvation:

Solution: Implement fair scheduling policies that ensure all threads get a chance to access resources. Techniques like priority aging (increasing the priority of waiting threads over time) can prevent indefinite starvation.

5. Priority Inversion:

Solution: Use priority inheritance or priority ceiling protocols. With priority inheritance, a low-priority thread holding a resource needed by a high-priority thread temporarily inherits the higher priority. Priority ceiling protocols preemptively set the priority of a thread to the highest priority of any thread that might access the same resources.

6. Thread Interference:

Solution: Carefully design the synchronization of threads to minimize the interaction between concurrent threads. Use thread-safe data structures and atomic operations to prevent threads from interfering with each other.

7. Memory Consistency Errors:

Solution: Employ memory barriers or atomic operations to ensure the correct ordering of read and write operations across threads. Using higher-level abstractions like concurrent data structures provided by libraries or language runtimes can also help avoid these errors.
